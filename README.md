# Navy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Eadroma/Navy.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/github/Eadroma/Navy) 

The goal was to code a terminal version of the famous [Battleship game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)),
using **SIGUSR1** and **SIGUSR2** [signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) to communicate between the 2 players.
